# Object-Tracking-with-Opencv-and-Python
In this ppriject we will learn how to use Object Tracking with Opencv and Python.  First of all it must be clear that what is the difference between object detection and object tracking:  Object detection is the detection on every single frame and frame after frame. Object tracking does frame-by-frame tracking but keeps the history of where the object is at a time after time  We will talk first about object detection and then about how to apply object tracking to the detection.
